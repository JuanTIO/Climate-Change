      The Earth's Climate Has Changed Since The Moment It Existed
    </h3>
    <ul class= "text">
   
      <li> In the last 650,000 years, there have been several cycles of glacial advances and retreat toward the end of the ice age. These changes marked the beginning of both the modern climate era and human civilization. 
        Most climate changes occur because of the small but significant variations in Earth’s orbit. Earth’s orbital change causes variation in the amount of solar energy the planet receives. </li>
    
       <li>Since these changes are so minimal, the Earth’s orbit causes little change to the climate and temperature. But as civilization evolved, the human race caused more unnatural changes to the environment.
        As the years have gone by, the human race has been able to take advantage of many non-renewable resources in order to create a more advanced society. </li>
       <li> Our overuse of the resources have caused a significant increase of many chemicals in the atmosphere which caused a much greater climate change than any the planet has faced before. </li>

  <h3>
      Every Day, Gases Are Being Released Into The Atmosphere
    </h3>
  <ul class= "text">
    <li>This causes the planet to heat up more rapidly than usual. The atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
      Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere that do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. </li>
     <li>Gasses, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as “feedbacks.” Carbon dioxide is a more prominent greenhouse gas that can be released both natural and through human involvement.
      Carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcanic eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels.  </li>
     <li>The most common fossil fuel used in our society is gasoline. Gasoline is used to power most vehicles throughout the entire planet. Humans have managed to increase Atmospheric CO2 by more than a third from the industrial revolution.
      Burning fossil fuels has become so common throughout the world that is forcing climate change rather than allowing the climate to change in the natural order it was meant to. </li>

    <h3>
      Carbon Dioxide In The Enviroment 
    </h3>
  <ul class= "text">
      <li>Earth's ocean's contain more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere, and are capable of absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. </li>
      <li>The ocean does not trap heat the way the atmosphere does. 
        Whenever Carbon Dioxide leaves the ocean and enters the atmosphere, it contributes to spreading a warmer climate in the surrounding area</li>
      <li> The tectonic process has causesd Continents to move to different positions on the globe. 
        300 million years ago Britian was near the equator which made it much hotter than it is today</li>
      <li>The plates moving has also caused Volcanoes and mountains to form which are major contributors to releasing green house gases into the atmosphere that results in warmer temperatures all across the world.</li>
