Buildings contribute to a lot of greenhouse gas emissions (1/3) of all green house gas emissions. Infrastruture upgrades would help. (I.E. measures to control building temperatures so that less energy is used to regulate the building environment)
Heating cement causes climate change (creating new roads) Finding new eco friendly ways to heat cement would help.
Transportation is the second largest cause of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the U.S. Electric Transportation would cut down on Greenhouse gases.
Consuming Less fossil fuels and recycling overall would help lower greenhouse gas emissions
Preventing Deforestation (trees Absorob CO2)
Being more mindful of one's energy usage
Solar-Thermal Power or nuclear fission
Source: Scientific American

Solar thermal power (electricity) generation systems collect and concentrate sunlight to produce the high temperature heat needed to generate electricity. All solar thermal power systems have solar energy collectors with two main components: reflectors (mirrors) that capture and focus sunlight onto a receiver. In most types of systems, a heat-transfer fluid is heated and circulated in the receiver and used to produce steam. The steam is converted into mechanical energy in a turbine, which powers a generator to produce electricity. Solar thermal power systems have tracking systems that keep sunlight focused onto the receiver throughout the day as the sun changes position in the sky.

 Nuclear Fission-  subdivision of a heavy atomic nucleus, such as that of uranium or plutonium, into two fragments of roughly equal mass. The process is accompanied by the release of a large amount of energy.
 
 hydrofluorocarbons warm the atmosphere 1000 to 9000 times more than carbon dioxide depending on their content. The kigalil Agreement requires certain countries to filter out the use of HFCs this year
 
 My name is Ajani Adovor. I am currently a freshman at Upper Darby High School. My favorite subject is currently my AP Computer Science Principles. I found about the Tech It Out through my seminar teacher. I live in a suburb called Drexel Hill in Pennsylvania. My interests include computer science, engineering, economics. In my spare time I enjoy coding, reading science fiction novels, playing video games, checking the NASDAQ, and sometimes even writing stories. I also run track. This program has greatly increased my interests in the HTML and .CSS coding languages and I plan to use the skills I learned from this program in the future.
