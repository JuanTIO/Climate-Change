      My name is Franco Cima and I am a Sophmore at SS. John Neumann and Maria Goretti High School. I found out about the Tech It Out program from my school counselor. 
      She sent an email explaining the program and provided us with the application to apply. The minute I heard it was a program on coding I was immediately interested because coding was a skill I have always wanted to learn.
      I applied along with a few of my friends and we all got in. Throughout this program I have been given the opportunity to work with and learn from experts in coding.
      Creating my own website on climate Change has been one of the most game changing experiences of my life. For the first time in my life I have an idea about what I want to make a career out of. 
      I plan on continuing in this field by taking a College Course on Computer Science for my Junior year of high school.

       My name is Ajani Adovor. I am currently a freshman at Upper Darby High School. My favorite subject is currently my AP Computer Science Principles. 
      I found out about Tech It Out through my seminar teacher. I live in a suburb called Drexel Hill in Pennsylvania. My interests include computer science, engineering, economics. 
      In my spare time I enjoy coding, reading science fiction novels, playing video games, checking the NASDAQ, and sometimes even writing stories. I also run track. 
      This program has greatly increased my interests in the HTML and .CSS coding languages and I plan to use the skills I learned from this program in the future.

      I am Juan Josue Madera, a Junior at Community Academy of Philadelphia CS. I was born and raised in North Philadelphia to two Dominican parents who only speak Spanish and moved here in their twenties. I learned of Tech It Out through my Computer Progaming teacher who sent me the application to me and a few of my classmates. I applied with them and got in. Tech it out has been a great experience
       to learn about college,coding, and temwork. I wanted to build my page on climate change becuase climate change is an important issue that affects everyone. When I grow up I still want to see the beautiful trees, plants and animals that made my childhood special. I want the same for my kids and their kids.
