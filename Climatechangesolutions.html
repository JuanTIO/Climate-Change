      Our Final Hope: Solutions To Reverse Climate Change
    </h2>
      <h3>
        Reconstructing The Technologies We Already Have 
      </h3>
    <ul class="text">
      <li>
          An advancement in modern infrustructure would help climate change. Buildings contribute to (1/3) of all green house gas emissions. Infrastruture upgrades would help. <br>(I.E. measures to control building temperatures so that less energy is used to regulate the building environment)
      </li>

      <li>   
        Heating cement causes climate change (creating new roads). Finding new eco friendly ways to heat cement would help. Asphalt in general heats urban 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Farenheit. <br> If there was a replacement for asphalt in cities, their environments would be greatly cooled.  
      </li>

      <li>      
        Transportation is the second largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Many drivers in the U.S. use petroleum based fuels, which is a fossil fuel. <br> Electric transportation would greatly decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Consuming less fossil fuels and recycling overall would help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

      </div>
        
      <li>      
        Deforestation is a major problem around the world. It is the act of cutting down entire forests of trees. Not only does this leave many animal species displaced, but it also affects climate change because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a chemical that tears through the ozone layer.
      </li> 
      <h3>
        Alternate Forms of Energy that Combat Climate Change
      </h3>
      <li>
        Fossil fuel emmissions are a major cause of climate change as they destroy the ozone layer.
      </li>
      <li>      
        Using different types of energies will also help combat climate change. Solar thermal power generates electricity from the sun. <br> Solar panels do this by collecting and reflecting enough sunlight through mirrors to create a high enough heat to create electricity. Wind farms also use solar power to create electricity, since wind is a form of solar energy (as it is created by the heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the rotation of the earth, and Earth surface irregularities).
      </li>

    <li>
      Nuclear thermal energy is also another alternate source of energy that could help prevent climate change. Nuclear Fission is the process in which energy is created. When a heavy atomic nucleus subdivides in a substance such as plutonium or uranium into an equal mass, a large amount of energy is released. 
      This energy is harvestable, however many find this form of energy controversial. Accidents involving nuclear power plants have made many skeptical about the safety of this form of energy. Fukushshima, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island are all infamous cases in which nuclear power failed and radiation leaked into the surrounding areas. However, it has recently been proven that the long term effects of nuclear radiation aren't as harmful as previously thought, making it a potential source of energy that could power our future.
